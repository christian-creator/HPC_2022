Peer review - week 11: Frederik
By: Caroline

EX1:
As per usual you have some good solutions, with code written in a pythonic way
and with very nice structure, that makes it easy to follow. With very clever
solutions on how you add a single character to the string, instead of loading a
whole new one, while also making sure that you only allow kmers with the correct
letters to pass through.

And also a cheeky way of making sure that it only prints ten kmers by using your
max_c variable. If I have understood it correctly, this is very cheeky way of
saving some time.

Previously you have been a fond user of reading files as bytes, but you have
skipped this here, why?

You have written a few comments, which I guess are more speculations, but again
it would be nice with some descriptive comments as well.

EX2:
Again, beautiful solutions and coding style. Would like some comments. As I
guess it was intended you have reused a lot of code, so above comments still
stand.

Something that I noted was the use of a mask:
"""
mask = int(k * '11', 2)
"""
Personally, I found this very interesting that you did it this way. Very fun :)

Generally, I would have liked a few more comments with your code, as it would
first of all make it easier to read, and second of all maybe to share some of
your considerations.
