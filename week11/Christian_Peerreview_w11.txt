Peer review - Week 11: Christian
By: Frederik

Yo, it's all pretty nice, my dude. Your functions are well structured and well-commented.

As we discussed, you can cut runtime by adding the bytes to the prior k-mer and cutting off the other end instead of re-making the k-mer every time.

Also note that you will miss one k-mer at the end of every seq, as

for i in range(0,len(seq) - kmer_lengt):

never reaches len(seq) - kmer_lengt, but only len(seq) - kmer_lengt - 1. Thus it should be

for i in range(0,len(seq) - kmer_lengt + 1):

Nice idea with the load balancing as well. Not much to say :)
