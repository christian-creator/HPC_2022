Peer Evaluation of Frederik W3
By: Caroline

Exercise 1:

Really nice work. The spacing in the structure of the codes is really nice and makes 
each "chunk" easy to follow. Personally, I would have added a few more comments in 
order to make the code just a tad bit more readable. Variable naming is also nice and 
easy to follow.

When manipulating the dates I think it is very clever of you to have used the datetime
package. I cannot really see much to comment on, as I find this solution short and to
the point. All requirements mentioned in the exercise are fulfilled. So great job :)


Exercise 2:
Generally the same comments as mentioned above. I like how you did this, with the dic.
As mentioned above it would have been really nice with a few more comments, especially
around the function, so that it was easier to follow. 

Again, all requirements in the exercise are fulfilled.
