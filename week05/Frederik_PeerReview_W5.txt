Peer Review Frederik Week 5
By: Caroline Uldahl

Generally, I think this is a really good solution. It feels, as if you have 
added more comments, which is really nice and makes it much easier to follow.
Also, really nice spacing and structure.

It seems as if you have implemented a lot of the things I at least tried to
implement in my code, in order to optimise it. So, really nice, I will maybe
try to get inspiration from your solutions, to further better my own :) 

Something, that I at least thought of when reading your code, was how you 
initialize your translation table. You are calling it multiple times in, as 
it is inside a for loop. Personally, I have done differently, but I do not
know if it is better to keep it as a local parameter, or easier to just do it
once. I am sure, it is not that time consuming either way.
