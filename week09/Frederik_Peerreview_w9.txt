Peer review - Week 9: Frederik
By: Caroline

EX1
Your exercise 1 is well structured. Simple and easy to read, though it would be
nice with some descriptive comments throughout the code, for example before each
function, to let the reader/user know what the function is intended to do. As we
were asked to time the different solutions, it would have been interesting if
you had inserted the time used in a comment.

Your solution is as always also really nice. I especially liked your
fasta_entries function. You have reused a lot of your previous code for this
exercise, as it was intended, so nothing new.

EX2
I can see that you have changed your way of indexing, since week 7, so that it
now works with a while loop. Really nice :) Also really nice use of trackers.
You have a few more comments in this one, which is nice. As far as I have
understood we were supposed to have the reverse_complement function output files
with the complement strand. It seems as if this is not done in your solution.
Although, this probably makes your solution quicker and looks nicer (at least
compared to my solution with the files).

EX3
Here you have done the exact same, just changing output_fasta to input_fasta in
line 92, but I bet you knew that ;) But I might have to make a comment on whether
you have solved the exercise, as it says that the worker function should write
the complement strand directly back into the file at the right place, which to
my knowledge is not done here. So again it would have been nice to see how you
would have solved this exercise.

Your code is as always very solid and nice.
