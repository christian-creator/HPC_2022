Peer review - Week 9: Christian
By: Caroline

EX1:
As per usual your code is very nice, which makes it easy to follow. You do have
a lot of functions, which compartmentalizes the code nicely. Personally, I think
it would be nice if you had added just a few more comments to this exercise, e.g.
just adding a line above each function with a small message of what it does, it
would be a great supplement to the already descriptive function names. Really
nice efficient solution. Really nice way of iterating through all k-mers
minimally.

EX2:
Here you have more comments, which is really nice.

Really cool that you sort the chromosomes by bits, to make sure that the
chromosomes are sorted nicely before running it. Very clever way of implementing
the least-load method. Did you find out if it made a difference with and without
sorting?

As the rest of us has done, you have also found kmers based on the sequence.
It would be cool if you had added a few thoughts on how to find all kmers if you
had chosen to do it in chunks.

Now you have not written the time it took for you to run this on human.fsa, but
from what I remember you said it took ~3 min, which also tells that you have
solved this exercise VERY good.

I don't know what to say.. amazing job!
