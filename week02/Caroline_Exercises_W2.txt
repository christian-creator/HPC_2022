CREATE DATABASE s183493;

USE s183493;

# Creating the tables
CREATE TABLE persons (
cpr VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL,
first_name VARCHAR(30),
last_name VARCHAR(30),
height INT(10) UNSIGNED,
weight INT(10) UNSIGNED,
biological_mother VARCHAR(11) DEFAULT NULL,
biological_father VARCHAR(11) DEFAULT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(cpr));

CREATE TABLE marriage (
male_cpr VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL,
female_cpr VARCHAR(11) NOT NULL,
marriage_start CHAR(8) NOT NULL,
marriage_end CHAR(8) DEFAULT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(male_cpr, female_cpr));

CREATE TABLE disease (
cpr CHAR(11) NOT NULL,
name_disease VARCHAR(40),
date_discovery VARCHAR(8));

# Loading the file contents into the tables

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ’/home/projects/pr_course/persons.csv’ INTO TABLE persons
 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ’,’
 (cpr, first_name, last_name, height, weight, biological_mother, biological_father);

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ’/home/projects/pr_course/marriage.csv’ INTO TABLE marriage
 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ’,’
 (male_cpr, female_cpr, marriage_start, marriage_end);

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ’/home/projects/pr_course/disease.csv’ INTO TABLE disease
 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ’,’
 (cpr, name_disease, date_discovery);

2.1: Who do not have a father ?
Command: SELECT first_name FROM persons WHERE biological_father = ' ';

2.2: How many do not have a mother?
Command: SELECT COUNT(cpr) FROM persons WHERE biological_mother = ' ';
Result: 92

2.3: How many cases of cancer - any type?
Command: SELECT COUNT(cpr) FROM disease WHERE name_disease LIKE '%Cancer';
Result: 147

2.4: How many persons had cancer – any type?
Command: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(cpr)) FROM disease WHERE name_disease LIKE '%Cancer';
Result: 128

2.5: Who are or have been married to someone named ’Finn’?
Command: SELECT COUNT(male_cpr) FROM marriage WHERE male_cpr IN (SELECT male_cpr FROM persons WHERE first_name = 'Finn');
Result: 276

2.6: Create 2 imaginary persons. Marry them to each other. Make them have a kid. Give the kid a broken nose. Insert all this info in the database.
Command:
INSERT INTO persons (cpr, first_name, last_name, height, weight) VALUES ('120795-5609', 'Ole','Ulriksen', 145, 77);
INSERT INTO persons (cpr, first_name, last_name, height, weight) VALUES ('090698-9722', 'Solvej','Ågaard', 177, 75);
INSERT INTO marriage (male_cpr, female_cpr, marriage_start) VALUES ('120795-5609', '090698-9722', '05092022');
INSERT INTO persons (cpr, first_name, last_name, height, weight, biological_mother, biological_father) VALUES ('250323-6170', 'Æbleskive','Ågaard', 153, 50, '090698-9722','120795-5609' );
INSERT INTO disease (cpr, name_disease, date_discovery) VALUES ('250323-6170','Broken nose', '29022036' );

2.7: Delete everyone with the last name ’Rapacki’. Make sure that database is consistent afterwards, like there is no marriages to non-existing persons or references to non-existing parents.
Notes to self on how to solve this exercise:
"Rapacki" appears in the persons table both people who has it as a last name and
 for people where people with the "Rapacki" last name are parents. Furthermore,
 it appears in the disease table, every time a "Rapacki" has had a disease. This
 also applies for the marriage table. So, the people with a "Rapacki" parent, as
 they should not be deleted, I will use the update function and change the parent
 to NULL. Afterwards I will delete them from the disease and marriage table.
 Lastly, they should be deleted from the persons table. This should be done last
 so that I can make a "list" of their cpr numbers for the other deletions (This
 should be done with the IN function).

Command:
UPDATE persons SET biological_mother = NULL WHERE biological_mother IN (SELECT cpr FROM persons WHERE last_name = 'Rapacki');
UPDATE persons SET biological_father = NULL WHERE biological_father IN (SELECT cpr FROM persons WHERE last_name = 'Rapacki');

DELETE FROM disease WHERE cpr IN (SELECT cpr FROM persons WHERE last_name = 'Rapacki');

DELETE FROM marriage WHERE male_cpr IN (SELECT cpr FROM persons WHERE last_name = 'Rapacki') OR female_cpr IN (SELECT cpr FROM persons WHERE last_name ='Rapacki');

DELETE FROM persons WHERE last_name = 'Rapacki';
