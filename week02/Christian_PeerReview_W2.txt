Peer review of exercises from week 2 - Christian
By: Caroline Uldahl

Generally, I think the exercise is really nice. I especially like your comments
which enhances the readability of the code, even though sql is quite readable to
begin with.

In your table setup there are a few field specifications I personally would have
changed, but you use what ever floats your boat, these are just suggestions.
In your marriage table you have set the default value of both cprs to
NULL. I would have changed this to NOT NULL as you also use it as primary key
and therefore needs to be inputted. I believe that NOT NULL could also be
beneficial to add to the other cprs in the other tables.

In exercise 2 I believe you skipped question 3, but I believe you just missed
it :)
