Feedback on Frederik's Exercises

Exercise 1.
The solution resembles mine a lot; thus, I do not have many comments as I also find this solution to be good. 
Still, there are some pretty cool differences, like using different datatypes, including the DATE and SMALLINT data types. 

Exercise 2.
1)
The same solution as mine, although you use the keyword IS where I use =. I could imagine that IS might be faster.
2)
The same solution as mine, although you use the keyword IS where I use =. 
3) â€“ 4)
Here I only use "%cancer" so your solution is more general than mine. Furthermore, I did not use distinct keywords but rather counted the number of times the word cancer is present. 
Thus your solution is better, and min only solves 1 of the two problems >:(
5)
Here we had the exact same solution. Pretty cool!
6)
Pretty uncool, making me 157cm when in actuality I'm 207 cm. Still, my birthday was accurate. 
6)
I liked your solution here by lastly deleting the 'Rapacki' people from the person database and using their CPR numbers to delete them from the other databases. 
Still, I found that there are references to people not found in the person database, which is not from the Rapacki database. Therefore, it would have been cool to do something like:

DELETE FROM marriage WHERE male_cpr NOT IN (SELECT CPR FROM person) or female_cpr NOT IN (SELECT CPR FROM person);
