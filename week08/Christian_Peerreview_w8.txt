Peer review Week 8 - Christian
By: Caroline

General thoughts on code structure:
Really good structure. The functions also makes it very nicely compartmentalized.
You have a good amount of high quality comments, which makes it easy to follow.
The functions and variables are also named in a way that they make sense. For me
it would have been nice if each function had a small comment linked to it, describing
what it does, even though they have clear names and are understandable. I see that
this would especially be beneficial for functions with long comprehensions.

Thoughts on the solution:
A really nice solution where you can tell that you have experimented with different
methods of optimization, which is great to see and also a big inspiration for a
"beginner optimizer" as myself. I tried running your code on my own computer, to
test out some ideas for optimization, but were unable to find anything, that decreased
the time substantially.
