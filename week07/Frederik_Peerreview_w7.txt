Peer review - Week 7: Frederik
By: Caroline

Generally, I always enjoy your solutions. You can really tell that you are
really good at utilizing the different skills that you have aquired throughout
the years, as well as new stuff. 

As you have mentioned yourself you did not optimize the code. In order to do so,
you have written some ideas yourself, I think these ideas are great. 

For exercise 2 I also think you have done great with the coding. Personally, I 
would have liked a few more comments, but with a simple code like this one, it 
is debatable.
