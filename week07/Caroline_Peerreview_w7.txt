Peer review - Week 7: Caroline

General thoughts on the code:
Generally, I think that the very logical structure of the code makes it very easy to read. However, it might have been nice to have some comments explaining 
more in detail what you did. Still, I think your solution is very readable and with nice spacing

General thoughts on solution:
Although your solution makes logical sense, I do not think it is completely optimized. In my solution, I read the fastafile in chunks by using
a "while loop" which greatly enhanced the speed of my programme. This can also be seen in your solution's performance, which uses roughly 9s to complete 
indexing, while mine used 0.76s on a computerome-node. The hard part of reading in chunks with a while-loop is figuring out how to identify the ">"
headers. I did this by using the .find() function, which returns the byte of the chunk where the header was found. When I have found a header, I can then 
look for a "\n" to identify when the header is done. From these two positions, I can calculate all information necessary for indexing.


Furthermore, i am confused as to how you got the .tell() function to work in a for-loop. Online it seems that this function can be
imprecise when used in a for-loop which can result in errors of you indexes. See link below for explanation:

Still, i think that you solution is good!
