Peerreview Frederik Week 4

Comments on code:
General thoughts on the code:
Generally, I think that both the structure and the readability of the code are very satisfying in both the four copy scripts as well as the bash script and summary text file.

As I think your solution resembles mine, I do not have many comments on the actual solution. 
Maybe it would have been cool to comment on the fastest script in the summary copy_performance results. 
However, as there is a ranking, it is pretty easy to read. Still, it is up to the reader to interpret your results... i don't know...

Very good solution!
