Peerreview Caroline Week 4

You forgot to close the files in mycopy2.py, but otherwise the code is perfect!

It would be great to indicate within the files as comments or in the script names what kind of file copy is performed. Just an idea - haven't done it myself either, lol.

Your observations a great as well. Very nice :)
