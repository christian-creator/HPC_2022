Peerreview Christian Week 4
By: Caroline

I can see that you have made the 4 programs and have timed them with the command
time. I do not really have any comments on this, I could not have asked for
more. 

In your notes.txt you have inputted the times of all the programs, except for
the cp command. Here it would have been nice if this had also been shown. As far
as I have understood, we were also supposed to write a small text that explained
the differences in the execution time. This seems to be missing from the solution.
Please correct me if I am wrong :)
